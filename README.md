# Good, Bad, or Ugly Card Draw

This project is a Python script that generates a 4x6 PDF document for the "Good, Bad, or Ugly"
card game, featuring a grid layout with color-coded suits.

## What is "Good, Bad, or Ugly"?

"Good, Bad, or Ugly" is a set of rules for bowling poker, a game of poker typically played by
league bowlers. It involves drawing cards from a deck based on how well one bowls. This game
serves as a handicap for games that may have bowlers that mark more than others by providing
random chances in which one or all players will have to discard their hands and start over.
Let's face it, bowling poker is more fun if the same person isn't always winning the pot.

The rules of this bowling poker game are:
- Draw two cards for bowling a strike.
- Draw one card for picking up a non-split spare.
- Draw two cards for picking up a split spare.
- If a player draws a "Bad" card then they discard their hand.
- If a player draws an "Ugly" card then all players discard their hands.
- Cards must be drawn in player bowl order.
- Draw cards one at a time and evaluate "Good, Bad, or Ugly" with each card in succession.

Another good rule is to always mix up the bowling order so the same bowler isn't in the anchor
position each week of the league. Bowling last is an advantage in "Good, Bad, or Ugly."

## Features

- **Random Card Drawing**:
  - Draws unique cards for three separate games
  - No card _value_ is repeated within a single game and no _card_ is repeated across all games
- **PDF Output**: Generates a PDF document for printing/displaying during the bowling match
- **4x6 Grid Layout**: Organizes each game into two columns (Bad and Ugly)
- **Color-Coded Suits**: 
  - Hearts (♥) and Diamonds (♦) displayed in **red**
  - Clubs (♣) and Spades (♠) displayed in **black**
- **Unique Values Per Game**: Ensures no duplicate card values within each game
- **Large Font Size**: 14pt font for easy reading and suit distinction

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- reportlab library

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install the required dependency:

```bash
pip install reportlab
```

## Usage

Simply run the script:

```bash
python draw-cards.py
```

This will generate a PDF file named `good_bad_ugly_cards.pdf` in the same directory.

## Game Structure

The script draws cards for three games with the following distribution:

- **Game 1**: 4 Bad cards, 3 Ugly cards
- **Game 2**: 5 Bad cards, 4 Ugly cards  
- **Game 3**: 4 Bad cards, 6 Ugly cards

## Card Rules

- Each game uses a standard 52-card deck (2-K, no Aces)
- Within each game, no card value can appear twice (regardless of suit)
- Cards are drawn randomly and uniquely for each category
- The deck is shuffled before each run

## Output

The generated PDF includes:
- Professional title header
- 6-column table layout (3 games × 2 categories each)
- Alternating row colors for readability
- Grid lines for clear separation
- Color-coded suits for easy identification
